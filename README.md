# SDL_kitchensink

[![CI](https://github.com/katajakasa/SDL_kitchensink/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/katajakasa/SDL_kitchensink/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

FFmpeg and SDL2 based library for audio and video playback, written in C99.

Documentation is available at http://katajakasa.github.io/SDL_kitchensink/

Features:

* Decoding video, audio and subtitles via FFmpeg
* Dumping video and subtitle data on SDL_Textures or software surfaces
* Dumping audio data in the usual mono/stereo interleaved formats
* Automatic audio and video conversion to SDL2 friendly formats
* Synchronizing video & audio to clock
* Stream seeking
* Bitmap, text and SSA/ASS subtitle support
* Video hardware decoding (optionally)

Note! Master branch is for the development of v2.x.x series.

* v1 can be found in the rel-kitchensink-v1 branch. Only smaller bugfixes will be accepted / added.
* v0 is no longer in development, and no fixes of any kind will be made or accepted.

## 1. Installation

Nowadays you can find SDL_kitchensink in eg. linux repositories. Installation might be as simple as
running the following (or your distributions' equivalent):

```apt install libsdl-kitchensink libsdl-kitchensink-dev```

If you are running on windows/MSYS2 or on linux distributions where the package management does not
have kitchensink, you will need to compile it yourself. Please see the "Compiling" section below.

## 2. Library requirements

Build requirements:

* CMake (>=3.7)
* GCC (C99 support required)

Library requirements:

* SDL2 2.0.5 or newer
* FFmpeg 5.0 or newer
* libass (optional, supports runtime linking via SDL_LoadSO)

Note that Clang might work, but is not tested. Older SDL2 and FFmpeg library versions
may or may not work; versions noted here are the only ones tested.

### 2.1. Debian / Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev \
    libavutil-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libass-dev
```

### 2.2. MSYS2 64bit

These are for x86_64. For 32bit installation, just change the package names a bit .

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw-w64-x86_64-libass
```

## 3. Compiling

By default, both static and dynamic libraries are built.

* Set BUILD_STATIC off if you don't want to build static library
* Set BUILD_SHARED off if you don't want to build shared library
* Dynamic library is called libSDL_kitchensink.dll or .so
* Static library is called libSDL_kitchensink_static.a
* If you build in debug mode (```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug```), libraries will be postfixed with 'd'.

Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as necessary to change the installation path. The files will be installed to

* CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib for libraries (.dll.a, .a, etc.)
* CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin for binaries (.dll, .so)
* CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include for headers

### 3.1. Building the libraries on Debian/Ubuntu

1. ```mkdir build && cd build```
2. ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..```
3. ```make -j```
4. ```sudo make install```

### 3.2. Building the libraries on MSYS2

1. ```mkdir build && cd build```
2. ```cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..```
3. ```make```
4. ```make install```

### 3.3. Building examples

Just add ```-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=1``` to cmake arguments and rebuild.

### 3.4. Building with AddressSanitizer

This is for development/debugging use only!

Make sure llvm is installed, then add ```-DUSE_ASAN=1``` to the cmake arguments and rebuild. Note that ASAN is not
supported on all OSes (eg. windows).

After building, you can run with the following (make sure to set correct llvm-symbolizer path):

```
ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=1 ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer ./complex <my videofile>
```

## 4. Q&A

Q: What's with the USE_DYNAMIC_LIBASS cmake flag ?

* A: It can be used to link the libass dynamically when needed. This also makes it possible to build the
  library without libass, if needed. Using this flag is not recommended however, and it will probably
  be deprecated in the next major version(s). If you use it, you might need to also patch the library
  path and name to match yours in kitchensink source.

Q: Why the name SDL_kitchensink

* A: Because pulling major blob of library code like ffmpeg feels like bringing in a whole house with its
  kitchensink and everything to the project. Also, it sounded funny. Also, SDL_ffmpeg is already reserved :(

## 5. Examples

Please see examples directory. You can also take a look at unittests for some help.
Note that examples are NOT meant for any kind of real life use; they are only meant to
show simple use cases for the library.

## 6. FFMPEG & licensing

Note that FFmpeg has a rather complex license. Please take a look at
[FFmpeg Legal page](http://ffmpeg.org/legal.html) for details.
